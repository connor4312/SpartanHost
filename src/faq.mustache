					What is the difference between your Budget Hosting and Premium Hosting?

					The main difference between our Budget Hosting and Premium Hosting plans is the processor we use. For our Premium Plans we use E3 - 1245v2, E3 - 1240v3, E3 - 1245v3 and E3 - 1270v3 processors with 1Gb/s uplink and SSDs whereas with our Budget Plans we use Intel Xeon L5520 and E5 - 2609v2 processors with 100Mb/s uplink and HDDs. Our Premium nodes are less crowded and under less load whereas our Budget nodes would be under more load as we fit more servers onto them. Premium plans also include free webhosting on all RAM plans and free dedicated IPs if you order 4GB RAM or more, Budget plans do not offer these features for free.
					<br><br>
					Our Budget Hosting plans are suitable for small to medium sized servers and our Premium Hosting plans are suitable for medium to large sized servers.
