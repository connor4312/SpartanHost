			<h1>Spartan Host Ltd Terms of Service <small>Last Updated: 3rd September, 2015</small></h1>
			<p>By subscribing to our website, server or other services you (the client) are in agreement with our Terms of Service (Spartan Host Ltd). Spartan Host Ltd reserves the right to cancel, suspend or terminate any service (subscription) provided with or without a refund or notice or warning for any reason. Spartan Host Ltd also reserves the right to change and modify the Terms of Agreement at any time with or without client notification. It is up to the client to periodically check and familiarise themselves with the recent Terms of Service. If any client does not comply with the new Terms of Service modifications, their service will be terminated.</p>
			<h2>Service Payment, Refunds and Cancellation Guidelines</h2>
			<p>All payment invoices are generated 10 days before payment is due. Failure to pay before the due date will result in suspended service until payment is received. Late payments are subject to a 10% late fee. After 8 days of non-payment, for a shared service and 7 days for a dedicated server, from the due date, the service will be terminated and Spartan Host Ltd will not be responsible for any data loss due to termination. Spartan Host Ltd only provides a 2-day refund period for the first billing period e.g. 1 month for monthly or 3 months for quarterly, from the invoice payment date, of a client using our Minecraft Plan, Web Hosting, VPS or DDOS Protection Services, our Dedicated Server plans are not eligible. Spartan Host Ltd reserves the right to deny refunds for their services with or without reason, regardless of the Service Refunds and Cancellation Guidelines if the user does not follow the Acceptable Use Policy or request e.g. a lot of support prior to requesting a refund or abuse such as spam. All cancellations must be given 5 days before the next billing due date. Refunds only apply for New Users/Accounts. Existing users with more than one subscription are eligible for no refunds. Chargebacks/Disputes will also be counted as a refund if within 2 days of the service being purchased otherwise they will be treated as fraud resulting in the service being suspended/terminated. All refunds must be requested via a <a href="https://billing.spartanhost.net/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=2" target="_blank">billing ticket</a>, requests made via any other method are not valid.</p>
			<p>By subscribing to our service the client agrees that they are over 18 and own the Paypal account or debit/credit card being used for payment or they have permission from the account/card owner. The client also agrees that if they select 'subscribe' on the invoice when paying with Paypal that payment will be taken automatically by Paypal when a new invoice is generated. If the client pays via our debit/credit card option then payment will be taken automatically on the due date if the client has not already paid their pending invoice until a cancellation request is issued.</p>
			<h2>Service Level Agreement</h2>
			<p>We do not guarantee 99.9% uptime however this is what we aim for. In the event that uptime is below 99.9%, compensation may be issued at the discretion of the CEO however it is not in anyway guaranteed apart from for Dedicated Servers. Premium plans are favoured over budget plans when issuing compensation for downtime issues. SLA credit will not be issued if our network or hardware is not to blame. Planned maintenance events and server upgrades are not eligible for SLA credit. SLA credit will be equal to one day's usage for every hour of outage, not to exceed one month's recurring charge given in the form of account credit only. We must be contacted via billing support ticket within 7 days of the downtime for a SLA credit claim to be valid. We reserve the right to deny a SLA credit claim at any time for any reason.
			<h2>Server File Backups</h2>
			<p>Spartan Host Ltd does not take backups of all services offered therefore clients are responsible for their own data management. We are not responsible for any data loss resulting from a client failing to backup their files to an external file server.</p>
			<h2>Client Server Sharing / File Responsibility</h2>
			<p>Spartan Host Ltd serves an environment with the sole purpose of providing hosting services and will not be held responsible for a client sharing his or her account (with admins/sub-users) or files stored on the said account. In the event where shared accounts with other users (admins/sub-users) become malicious to the client (due to conflicting interest, etc.), Spartan Host Ltd is not responsible for this action. Furthermore, all files stored on a client's server (except for the files that come standard) are also his or her responsibility and holds no merit with Spartan Host Ltd. Any files which are copyright and used or uploaded by the client are also the client's responsibility.</p>
			<h2>Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
			<p>Client agrees to not to attempt to modify the products or services as purchased from the original specifications. The client also agrees to not attempt to access any data or services outside of the client's given user directory. Client agrees to accept Mojang's EULA which can be found <a href="https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula" target="_blank">here</a>. Client agrees to monitor their disk space usage. In the event of major disk space usage by a client, we will take action which may incur data loss. Spartan Host Ltd will not be responsible for such data loss. Support tickets are limited to basic installations, configurations, and teaching users how to setup their server. For advanced plugin assistance, please refer to Google. Spamming of the ticket system will not be tolerated and may result in service termination. Allow up to 24 hours for responses. Spartan Host Ltd reserves the right to re-configure, reboot, or shut down any server as necessary in the event that it is adversely affecting the hardware or other users, with or without prior notice. If a dedicated server receives excessive attacks or attacks over 20Gb/s then we have the right to terminate the service. Disk space is limited by default to 30gb on premium plans and 50gb on budget plans to prevent misuse. If you require this limit risen then submit a support ticket. We are not responsible for any data loss that occurs due to hitting these disk space limits.</p>

			<b>Abuse Complaints</b><p></p>
			<p>If we receive an abuse complaint regarding e.g. spam mailing then we will forward it onto the client. We will allow up to 24 hours for a reply with a resolution, if we do not receive a resolution in this time then the network port of the service will be suspended pending a resolution. If the abuse continues on an ongoing basis then we are permitted to charge a fee for processing abuse reports.
			
			<p></p><b>Free Multicraft Installation Service</b><p></p>
			<p>Our 'Free Multicraft Installation' service is a one time only service per dedicated server. If you e.g. reinstall your OS then a charge will be incurred for the reinstallation of Multicraft. We are not responsible if the client's server is compromised after we do the Multicraft installation. The client is responsible for securing their own server appropriately.
			
			<p></p><b>Dedicated Server Bandwidth usage</b></p>
               <p>Once the client's dedicated server has 20% of its bandwidth allocation left, we will email them. Once the dedicated server reaches 100% usage of its allocated bandwidth, we will suspend the network port and contact the client again to work out a bandwidth upgrade.
            
            <p></p><b>VPS Bandwidth usage</b></p>
               <p>Once the client's VPS has 0% of its bandwidth allocation left, it is immediately suspended. Our gigabit ports are fair share meaning you cannot use a full gigabit inbound, outbound, or pps over 50,000 for a sustained period of time e.g. 10 minutes. If we find a client abusing this policy therefore affecting our network, they will be suspended and warned.
               
            <p></p><b>VPS CPU usage</b></p>
               <p>A VPS must not use 100% of every allocated core for more than 1 hour. E.g. if the client's VPS has 3 cores, they must not use 300% CPU for more than 1 hour at a time. There must be a break of 2 hours in between the 1 hour period. If the CPU usage is disruptive then we reserve the right to shutdown or suspend the VPS.

               <p>Dallas - 30Gb/s and 30Mpps TCP + UDP shared amongst multiple clients therefore we cannot guarantee a minimum protection level.</p>
